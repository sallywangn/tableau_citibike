New York Citi Bike Analysis using Tableau

In this NYC Citibike Analysis, I've created a map of all the start stations and the end stations with their latitude and longitudes. From the start sations map , we can clearly figure out that the most bikes are borrowed in Central Park S & 6th Ave station.

The pie chart shows that there are more males than females using citibikes, on the other hand the bar chart shows that females bikes longer distance. But there is also a large number of users with unknown gender, so the above conclusion is not comprehensive.

From the user type, we can find out that the 24-hour pass or 3-day pass user which is called customer has a longer average trip duration which is about 29 mins and the Annual Member which is called subscriber has a shorter trip duration which is about 18 mins. We can guess that customers are tourists or short-term users, so they are willing to use bicycles for entertainment for longer periods of time, while subscribers are likely to be local residents who use bicycles to commute, and short bicycle rides are more suitable for commuting.

Bike ID 15259 was used the most.
